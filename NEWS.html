        <p>The Supermarine S.4 was a 1920s British single-engined monoplane built by Supermarine to race in the 1925 Schneider Trophy contest. </p>To reduce drag forces and thereby increase speed, the company's chief designer, R. J. Mitchell, produced a floatplane of revolutionary design. Built of wood, and with an unbraced cantilever wing, it was powered by a Napier Lion engine developed to produce 700 horsepower 
        (520 kW) over a short racing period. Less than a month after its maiden flight on 24 August 1925, it raised the world's seaplane speed record to 226.752 miles per hour (364.922 km/h). On 23 October, during navigation trials prior to the contest, the aircraft was performing well when, for reasons that have not been fully explained, it went out of control and was destroyed when it dived into the sea 
        from 100 feet (30 m), injuring the pilot. Mitchell used the practical experience gained from his work on the S.4 when designing its immediate successor, the Supermarine S.5,The Presidio of San Francisco is a park and former United States Army post on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula in the city of San Francisco, California, forming part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The presidio was established as a fortified location in 1776, when New Spain founded it to gain a foothold in Alta California and the San Francisco Bay. It passed to Mexico in 1820, and in turn to the United States in 1848. As part of a military reduction program under the Base Realignment and Closure process from 1988, the United States Congress voted to end the presidio's status as an active military installation. In 1994, it was transferred to the National Park Service, ending 219 years of military use and beginning its next phase of mixed commercial and public use. This lithograph, published in 1822, shows the Presidio of San Francisco and its surroundings during the Spanish era, with the Golden Gate visible in the background to the right of the image.
        With high hopes of a British victory in the forthcoming Schneider Trophy competition at Bay Shore Park, Baltimore, the S.4, together with two Gloster III biplanes, was shipped to the US aboard the SS Minnewaska, free of charge.[16][17] During the voyage, Supermarine's pilot Biard slipped playing tennis, and injured his wrist.[17]
        Bad weather meant that those Schneider Trophy competitors that had already arrived for the competition had little opportunity to practise the course.[18] The aircraft were forced to remain in their crates while canvas hangars were being erected on the beach to accommodate them.[17] Biard caught influenza, but recovered sufficiently to participate in the competition. The windy conditions had, however, blown down the hangar where the S.4 was being kept, and the rear end of the aircraft had been damaged by a falling pole. The S.4 was repaired in time to take part in navigation trials on 23 October 1925.[1
        During 1925, Supermarine's chief designer, R. J. Mitchell, was working on a new aircraft to compete in that year's Schneider Trophy race.[1] The decision to begin the design process was made jointly by Napier and Supermarine on 18 March 1925.[2] Following the success of the Americans during the previous contest, Mitchell was fully aware of the need to reduce drag forces to increase speed. Supermarine's new design was for a mid-wing, cantilever floatplane. It was comparable to a French monoplane, the Bernard SIMB V.2, which had broken the flight airspeed record in December 1924.[3][4] The new design was in marked contrast to the flying boats Mitchell had designed for previous Schneider Trophy races, which had won in 1922 and come third behind the American Curtiss CR seaplanes in 1923.[5]
        The name S.4 was designated by Mitchell, "S" standing for Schneider.[3] He saw the three previous Schneider Trophy entrants (the Supermarine Sea Lion series) as S.1, S.2, and S.3;[2] the S.4 was the first Schneider Trophy entrant to be supported by the British government, who agreed to buy the aircraft if Supermarine and Napier covered the initial costs of development and construction.[6] The Air Ministry provided the British teams with greater freedom than was given by the US government to their designers.[3]
